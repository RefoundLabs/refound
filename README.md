# Refound, the Platform for verified Journalism
# Empowered and Protected on the Blockchain

Refoundâ€™s mission is part of the Regenerative Finance (ReFi) movement, specifically to leverage blockchain technology to help journalists and photographers directly sell their content to the public and news media at higher margins and with greater financial control, helping regenerate their economic cycle. Our decentralized application provides journalists a platform to share their content, monetize it, and maintain anonymity and safety by using a simple wallet sign-in.
